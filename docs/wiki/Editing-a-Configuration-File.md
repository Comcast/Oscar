# Editing a Configuration File

## Recommended Workflow
1. Generate a template for your spec/version (`-ftd`).
2. Edit with a plain text editor.
3. Compile with `-c` and verify by decompiling with `-d`.

## Editor Support
A Notepad++ user-defined language file is available in this repo:
- `Notepad++/`

Legacy editor XML can still be used if preferred.
